# Weather_App
    When planning on a vacation, people want to know the weather of the place they're going to beforehand, so they know how to prepare for it.
    With this site, the person is able to know the weather in Fahrenheit for 5 days (including the actual day). They just have to input the
    city name, state (if known), and the coutry code (ex: uk). Once they click Search, the weather will appear. Also, if you refresh the window, the weather will dissappear, but what you previously typed in the input will remain there, so you can just cick search again, and not write the whole thing again.
